nfs is used to sharing data from one machine to other machine locally
step to do in host machine ie nfs server:
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server

edit Vim /etc/exports
add these line
directory machine1(option11,option12) machine2(option21,option22)
eg.  /home/vpa8cob/Desktop/mnt *(rw,no_root_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
/home/dus5cob/nfsshare *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
/home/dus5cob/samba *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
/opt/tooling/ 172.17.0.1/255.255.0.0(rw,no_root_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)

sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart


step to do in guest machine ie in nfs client :
Mounting remote directories
mount 172.17.0.6:/home/vpa8cob/Desktop/mnt /mnt/

explanation :
diractory > 
the directory that you want to share. It may be an entire volume though it need not be. If you share a directory, 
then all directories under it within the same file system will be shared as well.

machine1 and machine2 >
client machines that will have access to the directory. ie ip addresses

optionxx

the option listing for each machine will describe what kind of access that machine will have. Important options are:

 ro: The directory is shared read only; the client machine will not be able to write to it. This is the default.

 rw: The client machine will have read and write access to the directory.

 no_root_squash: By default, any file request made by user root on the client machine is treated as if it is made by user nobody on the server. 
 (Excatly which UID the request is mapped to depends on the UID of user "nobody" on the server, not the client.) If no_root_squash is selected,
 then root on the client machine will have the same level of access to the files on the system as root on the server. 
 This can have serious security implications, although it may be necessary if you want to perform any administrative work on the client machine that involves the exported directories.
 You should not specify this option without a good reason.

 no_subtree_check: If only part of a volume is exported, a routine called subtree checking verifies that a file that is requested from the client is in the appropriate part of the volume.
 If the entire volume is exported, disabling this check will speed up transfers.

 sync: By default, all but the most recent version (version 1.11) of the exportfs command will use async behavior, telling a client machine that a file write is complete -
 that is, has been written to stable storage - when NFS has finished handing the write over to the filesysytem. 
This behavior may cause data corruption if the server reboots,and the sync option prevents this. See Section 5.9 for a complete discussion of sync and async behavior.

 Getting NFS File Systems to Be Mounted at Boot Time
 NFS file systems can be added to your /etc/fstab file the same way local file systems can, so that they mount when your system starts up
 vim /etc/fstab
 
 add these line 
    # device       mountpoint     fs-type     options      dump fsckorder
   ...
   master.foo.com:/home  /mnt    nfs          rw            0    0
   ...
eg   
my fstab file
vim /etc/fstab
 # /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
proc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0
# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation
UUID=d3372e97-ed10-4158-9e6e-57d9241fb48d /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1
# swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation
UUID=aa023a28-3ec9-4530-ad00-7f09016c47aa none            swap    sw              0       0

UUID=cc0e859d-637e-4868-b63e-9822ee9877bc   /home   ext4    errors=remount-ro   0   1
vmshare /home/dus5cob/vmshare   vboxsf  rw,uid=dus5cob,gid=dus5cob  0   0
#views  /mnt/views  vboxsf  rw,uid=dus5cob,gid=dus5cob  0   0
 ccstg  /mnt/ccstg  vboxsf  rw,uid=dus5cob,gid=dus5cob  0   0
